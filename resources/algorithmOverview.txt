1. Broadcast MwoeSearch to all neighbors to find MWOE
    a. track from whom we first received MwoeSearch
    b. if from tree edge
        i. mark self as received and ignore future MwoeSearch from tree edges
    c. else
        i. send MwoeResponse
2. when received MwoeResponse from all non-tree edges
        i. find min and then broadcast MwoeLocalMin to node from which we received MwoeSearch(eventually to leader)

3. Convergecast for leader to determine MWOE (this is MwoeLocalMin).
4. Broadcast for node with MWOE incident to know it has MWOE
5. Node with MWOE send message across MWOE
    • Buffer message until we have received broadcast with notification of MWOE
    • if have MWOE and received notification of neighbor having MWOE
        § send message to leader to notify all children on its tree that notifying of new leader
6. new leader must broadcast that merging is done for current round and build a new tree
    • upon receipt of this message
        i. increment round
        ii. unset isMarked for MwoeSearch
7. if am node with MWOE or have received MWOE notification, send message across MWOE with new leader UID
    • buffer message until we have received broadcast with notification of MWOE
convergecast to notify leader that merging completion is acknowledged and to build a tree as it proceeds to leader
